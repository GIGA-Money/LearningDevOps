"""
Interaction Between Signal and Vehicle
When a vehicle arrives at a signal, it will be added to the appropriate queue based on its current route.
The signal will periodically check its queues and allow vehicles to move forward if possible.
If a queue is congested, the signal will attempt to reroute vehicles in that queue to less congested routes.
Vehicles will update their routes based on the signal's rerouting decisions.
