# Roadmap

## for the order entry front end restaurant project

* Notes, I had a (HTML) class enter order, this was the high level class that contained the order entry, however, do need to subsitute that for a container class to hold the background and grid.
  * Lets use "Container" for the high level class.
  * I'll re-use "order entry" for the sub grid that hold the forms and input section.
  * I'll use a Header to hold the nav elements.
    * nav elements I can have those under a 'ul' and those can be links 'li'.
  * For the Main i'll have the titles under an 'h1', the welcome message under a 'p'.
  * The first sub section i'll have the entree order, then the toppings with it.
    * I'll use a card class strucutre, each card will have an image, 'h3' for the title, 'p' for description, and a 'button' for add to cart.
  * The second sub section will have topping additions and a price.
    * toppings additions, will stick with a drop down.
  * Scale as needed.
  * Will have an 'cart' option at the bottom to give an idea of what to look for.
  * Will use a footer section to have a site map and amout us details.
