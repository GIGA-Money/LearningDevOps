                        <li>Hit a bit of a writer block, couldn't bring myself

                        <li>Didn't do to well on writing today, was quite
                            distracted with the day trading.</li>
                        <li>Daily trade log:
                            <br> Closed the SPY 0DTE for a lose, its lose was
                            lower than the gains on the
                            small winner side:
                            <br>But this is fine as it wasn't a heavy trade
                            anyways.
                            <br>Tried to <s>exit</s> monetize some of the GOOG
                            130c contracts. Failed to get the limited
                            filled.
                            <br>Did monetize in the positive some of the GOOG
                            132c contracts. not much reward on those.
                            <br>Acquired additional contracts on $TSLA, 250c
                            6/16.

                            <br>Acquired additional contracts on SBUX, OI did
                            increase 1.71 2x, might also have been a bit
                            early.
                            <br>Missed the exit on the BA play, Sept monthlies.
                            Some recent bad news caused a sizeable
                            drop.
