                    <li>Hit a bit of a writer block, couldn't bring myself to finish the blog vid just yet.</li>
                    <li>Didn't do to well on writing today, was quite distracted with the day trading.</li>
                    <li>Daily trade log:
                        <br> Closed the SPY 0DTE for a lose, its lose was lower than the gains on the
                        small winner side:
                        <br>But this is fine as it wasn't a heavy trade anyways.
                        <br>Tried to <s>exit</s> monetize some of the GOOG 130c contracts. Failed to get the limited
                        filled.
                        <br>Did monetize in the positive some of the GOOG 132c contracts. not much reward on those.
                        <br>Acquired additional contracts on $TSLA, 250c 6/16.
                        <br>Acquired more aapl commons at 178.37.
                        <br>Acquired (bit prematurely) an additional TSM contract 10/20 105c. 4.95
                        <br>Acquired additional contracts on SBUX, OI did increase 1.71 2x, might also have been a bit
                        early.
                        <br>Missed the exit on the BA play, Sept monthlies. Some recent bad news caused a sizeable
                        drop.
