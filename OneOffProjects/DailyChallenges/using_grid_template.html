                        small winner side:
                        <br>But this is fine as it wasn't a heavey trade anyways.
                        <br>Tried to <s>exit</s> monitize some of the GOOG 130c contracts. Failled to get the limited
                        filled.
                        <br>Did monitize in the possitive some of the GOOG 132c contracts. not much reward on those.
