                <li>The caffeine pills are the white ones, and it might be
                    worth excepting those if I take any after 12pm <br>
                    and or want to do further testing with out it.</li>
                <li>Didn't get to pick up a custom selection, but will get
                    the other 2 blends complementary.</li>
                <li>Creativity was noted to benefit the presenter mind.</li>
