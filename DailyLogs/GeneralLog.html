                    <ul>
                        <li>Started out fine, Did a compressed air de-dusting (kind of needed a dishwasher on the case).</li>
                        <li>got the NVME drive installed in the underbelly side.</li>
                        <li>Even with getting into the OS right out of the gate.
                            <br>$hit started to hit the fan after I got booted in to the OS.</li>
                        <li>Started off without internet connected intentionally.</li>
                        <li>the old company ransomware, I know I shouldn't have installed, was still hanging around, and that was a nightmare, couldn't uninstall it for nothing.</li>
                        <li>Eventually I gave in and connected to the internet, in the hopes it would call home and I could use the help desk tool that was still hanging around.</li>
                        <li>I noticed after win caught up in updates, that the machine hung and wouldn't uninstall anything. 
                            <br>Then I saw that all the borderline ransomware tools had uninstalled themselves. 
                            <br>bit of a pipedream hope that worked out.</li>
                        <li>I finally left it in a point, with just the NVME drive and the old SSD (which apparently is very full, it might just hang around for its existing storage).
                            <br>I don't want to put in an HDD just to not use it. 
                            <br>The nvme drive has enough on it, and it might be more of a backup idle machine than the main shooter.</li>
