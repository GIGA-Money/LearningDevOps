                <li>Forgot about lunch, why?</li>
                <li>Because I ended up getting focused on working on reading up the old desktop.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Started out fine, Did a compressed air de-dusting (kind of needed a dishwasher on the case).
                    </li>
                    <li>got the NVME drive installed in the underbelly side.</li>
                    <li>Even with getting into the OS right out of the gate.
                        <br>$hit started to hit the fan after I got booted in to the OS.
                    </li>
                    <li>Started off without internet connected intentionally.</li>
                    <li>the old company ransomware, I know I shouldn't have installed, was still hanging around, and
                        that was a nightmare, couldn't uninstall it for nothing.</li>
                    <li>Eventually I gave in and connected to the internet, in the hopes it would call home and I could
                        use the help desk tool that was still hanging around.</li>
                    <li>I noticed after win caught up in updates, that the machine hung and wouldn't uninstall anything.
                        <br>Then I saw that all the borderline ransomware tools had uninstalled themselves.
                        <br>bit of a pipedream hope that worked out.
                    </li>
                    <li>I finally left it in a point, with just the NVME drive and the old SSD (which apparently is very
                        full, it might just hang around for its existing storage).
                        <br>I don't want to put in an HDD just to not use it.
                        <br>The nvme drive has enough on it, and it might be more of a backup idle machine than the main
                        shooter.

                <li>Take an LLM web tool today, what it it could be trained or even explicitly made to output sets of
                    instructions. <br>Such as in a code format.</li>
                <li>An ideal way for implementation would be an Computer Only interface language, COIL.</li>
                <li>The LLM would then make these Large instruction sets for a particular task, and would be executed on
                    an agent.</li>
                <li>These agents would be the key to an operational and acting side of the instructions.</li>
