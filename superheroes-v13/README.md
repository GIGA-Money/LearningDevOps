### Notes
* Never truly got this code to work, plan is to convert the full stack development project into a front end dev only project. Afterward, make this a reference project that has something working. 
* Not going to put up the run instructions because of the other issues that need fixing, but will at least attempt to get those to run. 
* Might have to use of one of the chat bois to help out with the oddities involved in the running issue.
