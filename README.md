# Resuming the jourey that took a pause
Log for 11/15/22
* Got a VBox with basic win 10 loaded up and ready to go. 
* Dont want to run into the issue I did on another machine, were I stacked to whole base OS with dev tools that I couldn't manage properly. 
* will need to get WSL up and funning, turned it on in the feature section, but didn't downlaod anything quite yet, might give it a few or just use the VM.

## Did reach out to a potential mentor for help
* Asked around, and looks like others are willing to help if one would just ask.

### Got some books in place
* good thing GIT never changes.
* got some basic aliases going.

Alias key:
cc = Checkout -
s = satus
cm = commit -m
* nothing crazy, will want to keep this key up. I am using these on the global level, shouldn't be to hard to manage.
