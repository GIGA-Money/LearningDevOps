* Got a VBox with basic win 10 loaded up and ready to go. 
* Dont want to run into the issue I did on another machine, were I stacked to whole base OS with dev tools that I couldn't manage properly. 
* will need to get WSL up and funning, turned it on in the feature section, but didn't downlaod anything quite yet, might give it a few or just use the VM.
* Did reach out to a potential mentor for help
* Asked around, and looks like others are willing to help if one would just ask.
* good thing GIT never changes.
* got some basic aliases going.

Alias key:

0. tree = log --graph --decorate --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit
1. cc = Checkout -
2. s = status -s 
    * (going with the short side, don't really need the big indicators, and keeps the bash cleaner)
3. cm = commit -m
4. cam - commit -a -m
* nothing crazy, will want to keep this key up. I am using these on the global level, shouldn't be to hard to manage.
