# Resuming the journey that took a pause
05/22/2023
- [x] Will continue to make this the testing and playground for new project types, but this repo will most likely be come just that, a testing lab.

05/08/2023
- [x] I had moved over, back in March, to a spring and angular project.
- [x] but this project got moved again to a ~~node.js~~ (nope back to spring)  and angular project. (follow along with the Full Stack Development repo for more)
- [x] so the finishing of this project will go into this learning dev ops project, a full stack dev project.

* Took my holiday break, maybe a bit to relaxed.
* got a book on Spring and Angular. Check back on an old spring project book, and it was a bit dated.
* got a book on some key algos, need the refresh.

* Turned to the LC practices for now:
* Middle of the Linked List - failed on the PY example unfortunately.
* Max Consecutive Ones - terrible implementation, I have 2 if checks in my for loop. 
    * discussion answers use a max comparison solution, I've see it used in other examples, I should learn to pick it up.
        * tool goes as such, in a comparison, have an incrementor start, perform the unfavored check.
        * if the unfavored check fails, performed the storage with a max comparison.
        * maxVal will always be saved and incrementor will restart.
        * return maxVal.

* LeetCode practice on "number of steps to reduce a number to Zero"
* and "FizzBuzz"

Log for 11/17/22
* been doing some LeetCode Practice, days this doesn't get progress, did stuff on LeetCode.
* I'll upload those snips to a file in this folder, just to get some contributions going on github.
* Doing those in Py3, CPP, Java, and C# (plus extra languages ones when able).
* Going for breath and learning language features rather than quantity of practices.

Log for 11/15/22
* Got a VBox with basic win 10 loaded up and ready to go. (mmmmmm might become to difficult to manage.)
* I do not want to run into the issue I did on another machine, were I stacked to whole base OS with dev tools that I couldn't manage properly.
* will need to get WSL up and funning, turned it on in the feature section, but didn't download anything quite yet, might give it a few or just use the VM.
* Did reach out to a potential mentor for help.
* Asked around, and looks like others are willing to help if one would just ask.
* good thing GIT never changes.
* got some basic aliases going.


### 7-26-23 Update:
* I will continue to update the individual logs as I do the task.
* Started a journal project using .NET core/Blazor web tools as a way to continue my learning journey.

### Got some books in place
* Git: Mastering Version Control, ISBN 978-1-78712-320-5 (now reference)
* Hands-On Kubernetes on Windows, ISBN 978-1-83882-156-2
* kubectl: Command-Line Kubernetes in a Nutshell, ISBN 978-1-80056-187-8 (Looking to skip)
* Spring Boot and Angular, ISBN 9781803243214 (main book)
* 40 Algorithms Every Programmer Should Know, ISBN 9781789801217


Alias key:

0. tree = log --graph --decorate --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit
1. cc = Checkout -
2. s = status -s 
    * (going with the short side, don't really need the big indicators, and keeps the bash cleaner)
3. cm = commit -m
4. cam = commit -a -m
* nothing crazy, will want to keep this key up. I am using these on the global level, shouldn't be to hard to manage.
