# Programming Language Classification Project

## Introduction
This project analyzes modern programming languages within the Chomsky hierarchy, focusing on the theoretical underpinnings of programming paradigms through formal language theory.

## Features
- Classification of programming language snippets into Chomsky hierarchy types.
- Tokenization and pattern recognition for language analysis.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NLTK library

## Usage
Run the main script to process code snippets:

`python mainSnippetClassification.py`

- or using the unit test

`python UnitTest.py`

## Testing
- To run tests, use the following command:

`python -m doctest -v mainSnippetClassification.py`

## Acknowledgments
- Noam Chomsky for foundational theories in formal language.
- John Backus and Peter Naur for the development of BNF.
